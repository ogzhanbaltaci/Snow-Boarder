# Snow-Boarder
Snow Boarder is a pretty small game where u play as Rick(our snowboarder) to get to the pole at the end of the level without crashing your head to the ground.

As you can see from the top picture i have used particle system to give effect of snow particles flying around while the board touches the ground.

As an addition i have added a rocket engine at the back of the Rick's snow board. If you push the UpArrow key the rocket will launch and it will give Rick a boost of speed which comes handy while climbing up the big hills. Again i have used particle effects to give the rocket engine to make it look like it shoots flames.

If you fall on your head while going through the level the game will play a death effect and the game will start again from the start.

If you manage to cross the pole without any incidents you will complete the level and the game will start over again.

This was a pretty small project that i mostly used it to learn basics of the particle system and the CinemachineBrain.
See you on the next project!
